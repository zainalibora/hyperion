## Introduction

Hyperion provides a robust framework for building custom Linux images. It leverages the OCI (Open Container Initiative) standards to ensure compatibility and ease of use. With Hyperion, developers can create atomic, image-based operating systems that are both flexible and secure.

## Features

- **Atomic Builds**: Create images that are built atomically, ensuring that the entire image is either fully built or not built at all.
- **Custom Images**: Tailor your Linux images to fit your specific needs, whether for development, testing, or production.
- **OCI Compliance**: Follow OCI standards to ensure compatibility across different platforms and environments.
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Deploy immutable images that do not change after they are created, enhancing security and stability.
